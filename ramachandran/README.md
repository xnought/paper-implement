# Ramachandran Plot

I want to read from a protein and plot out all the torsion angles.

## Notes

- Given 4 nodes and connections between them, we can define torsion angles to change the geometric configuration.
- Relative to what do we compute the angles?
- Compute torsion angle by computing differences between planes
