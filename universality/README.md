## Notes

- Damn 70 pages! You think I'm made of time! 
- Similarity of computation driven by statistical similarity of data distribution. Ie FFA arises because those that do process faces differently always perform better.
- Implies bidirectional: brains are similar to ANN then ANN similar to brain. Both ways the computations are similar.
