## Main Takeaways

1. Using fMRI to find functional selectivity in the brain works
2. By attaching more specific regions to function, we understand more about the brain
3. Face recognition is probably separate in computation and region

## Notes

- Visual recognition as (1) structure itself and (2) relation between structures
- Without imaging, people with brain damage to specific areas (but the brain can reorganize with what it has, so results a bit confounding here)
- Reproduced the PET experiments with fMRI: line drawings contrasted with line drawings scrambled to find functional regions that selectively activate
- Scrambling might reveal effort, not success
- Used Kolmogorov-Smirnov test whether the regular vs scambled come from fundamentally different distributions. If so, then we can do further testing.
- Identify voxels that are below the threshold as most activated.
- Conclude with more work to look at visual ventral pathway (recognition)
