## Notes

- When identity matters, intuition is favored, while deliberation is not (more authentic)
- While in other situations that require planning, obviously it makes sense to deliberate
- Intuitive choices signal authenticity
- Causal evidence: Experimentally change authenticity and people moves towards intuitive choices
- This is straight up comedy
	> "In the months leading up to his engagement, Charles Darwin evaluated the merits of marriage. An entry in his journal reveals systematic deliberation and analysis: a list of reasons favoring ‘marry’ on one side, those favoring ‘not marry’ on the other (Darwin, 1838). Darwin’s analysis is amusing not only because of the reasons he enumerates (notably “charms of music and female chit-chat” up against “less money for books” and “terrible loss of time”), but because he engaged in this analysis at all. For at least some modern readers, decisions about marriage should reflect love and commitment, not deliberation and enumeration." - from the paper Oktar et. al. linked above
-  Feels inauthentic in some situations to deliberate, but seems like critical thinking always leads to better results. What's up with that?
