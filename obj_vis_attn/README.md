## Notes

- Asked if perform better if attended to one more than another to give evidence that it was designed for / more computation for
- Scanned people specifically analyzing FFA (face), Parahippocampal place area (location), and MST area.
- Show all at once, and see which the person pays attention to the most.
- Based on the combination of what activated the most could rule out attending to motion, face, or location the most.
- Based on what processed the most, also check for other activations, which they conclude give evidence for object-based attention model
