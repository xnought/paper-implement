## Notes

- Lots of functional specific areas in the brain
- FFA mostly activates for faces
- Dude had FFA stimulated and face changes
- Yammins et. compared linear model (prob GLM) between the brain and model, promising results
- Then they tried for fMRI, same good results
- But what do you do after you conclude that a model is somewhat similar?
